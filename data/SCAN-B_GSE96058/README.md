This directory contains data related to GEO submission GSE96058 SCAN-B patient gene expression and survival data

Gene expression data was downloaded from GEO: 
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96058
This is a subseries that is part of the superseries GSE81540 
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81540

All gene expression data is within "GSE96058_gene_expression_3273_samples_and_136_replicates_transformed" and "GSE96058_transcript_expression_3273_samples_and_136_replicates"

Files to link gene expression IDs (F1, F2, etc) to the survival data via scan-b external id are within the Series Matrix File(s):
  GSE96058-GPL11154_series_matrix
  GSE96058-GPL18573_series_matrix

The Series Matrix Files also contain early clinical results, however updated clinical results were downloaded from the supplemental data of:
